# reviewer-s-comment
Dear Mr. XXX,
Your manuscript has been examined by the editors and qualified referee . We think the manuscript has merit but requires revision before we can accept it for publication in the Journal. Careful consideration must be given to the points raised in the reviewer comments, which are enclosed below.
If you choose to submit a revision of your manuscript, please incorporate responses to the reviewer comments into the revised paper. A complete rebuttal with no manuscript alterations is usually considered inadequate and may result in lengthy re-review procedures.
A letter detailing your revisions point-by-point must accompany the resubmission.
You will be requested to upload this Response to Reviewers as a separate file in the Attach Files area.
We ask that you resubmit your manuscript within 45 days. After this time, your file will be placed on inactive status and a further submission will be considered a new manuscript.
To submit a revision, go to http://ees.elsevier.com/lfs/ and log in as an Author. You will see a menu item called Submission Needing Revision. You will find your submission record there.
Yours sincerely,
Joseph J. Bahl, PhD
Editor
